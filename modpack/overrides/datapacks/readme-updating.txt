Thank you for downloading Random Item Skyblock!
Please refer to the GitHub and Wiki linked on the project page for customization and mod support information.


## Updating ##

Please update the modpack version, instead of the data pack version!
**Warning** - BACKUP YOUR WORLD, updating the modpack may overwrite your world files!

Changes made to the data pack version alone will NOT be reflected in your world!
If you manually change the version of the data pack anyways,
you must copy/move it from the "datapacks" folder in your instance to "saves/<WORLD>/datapacks" in order for it to function on that world!

If you manually update the data pack or Minecraft version past what is listed as compatible, it probably won't work!
